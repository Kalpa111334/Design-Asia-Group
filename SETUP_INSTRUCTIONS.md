# TrackFlow Vision - Setup Instructions

## üìã Overview

This document provides complete setup instructions for the TrackFlow Vision application, including database migrations and storage configuration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Supabase (Local Development)

```bash
npx supabase start
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

**Important:** If you encounter storage-related permission errors during migration, follow the workaround below.

```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

### 4. Configure Storage (Required for File Uploads)

Since storage configuration requires elevated permissions, it must be done manually:

#### Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Create a new bucket named `files` with these settings:
   - **Public**: Yes
   - **File size limit**: 10485760 (10MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: 
     - image/jpeg
     - image/png
     - image/gif
     - image/webp
     - application/pdf
     - text/plain
     - application/msword
     - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
     - application/vnd.ms-excel
     - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet

3. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** ‚Üí Select `files` bucket
4. Create three policies:

   **Policy 1: Allow Upload**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can upload files" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT TO authenticated
   WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'files');
   ```

   **Policy 2: Allow View**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view files" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT TO authenticated
   USING (bucket_id = 'files');
   ```

   **Policy 3: Allow Delete**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete files" ON storage.objects
   FOR DELETE TO authenticated
   USING (bucket_id = 'files');
   ```

#### Option B: Via SQL Editor

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/MANUAL_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`
3. Click **Run**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Migration Permission Errors

If you see errors like `must be owner of table objects`, this is a known Supabase limitation where migrations cannot create storage policies.

**Solution:** 
1. The migrations will still run successfully for all database tables
2. Configure storage manually using the instructions above
3. The application will work perfectly once storage is configured

### Common Issues

**Issue:** File upload not working
- **Cause:** Storage policies not configured
- **Fix:** Follow the storage configuration steps above

**Issue:** Database reset fails
- **Cause:** Cached migration files
- **Fix:** Try stopping and restarting Supabase:
  ```bash
  npx supabase stop
  npx supabase start
  npx supabase db reset
  ```
